## What are CGS Civil 3D Tools?
  
CGS Civil 3D Tools are a collection of tools that extend the capabilities of AutoCAD Civil 3D, a software that allows you to design and document civil engineering projects. CGS Civil 3D Tools are developed by CGS Labs, a company that specializes in civil engineering software solutions. CGS Civil 3D Tools are compatible with AutoCAD Civil 3D versions from 2015 to 2020.
  
CGS Civil 3D Tools include the following modules:
  
- Points Tools: a set of tools that allow you to create, edit, label, and manage points in AutoCAD Civil 3D.
- Alignment & Profiles Tools: a set of tools that allow you to create, edit, label, and manage alignments and profiles in AutoCAD Civil 3D.
- Pipes Tools: a set of tools that allow you to create, edit, label, and manage pipes and structures in AutoCAD Civil 3D.
- Surfaces Tools: a set of tools that allow you to create, edit, label, and manage surfaces in AutoCAD Civil 3D.
- Corridors Tools: a set of tools that allow you to create, edit, label, and manage corridors in AutoCAD Civil 3D.
- Sections & Quantities Tools: a set of tools that allow you to create, edit, label, and manage sections and quantities in AutoCAD Civil 3D.
- Labels & Tables Tools: a set of tools that allow you to create, edit, label, and manage labels and tables in AutoCAD Civil 3D.

## How to Use CGS Civil 3D Tools?
  
To use CGS Civil 3D Tools, you need to install them on your computer and activate them with a license key. You can download the installation file from the CGS Labs website[^1^] or request a free trial[^4^]. After installing CGS Civil 3D Tools, you will see a new ribbon tab called "CGS" in your AutoCAD Civil 3D interface. From there, you can access all the tools and features of CGS Civil 3D Tools.
  
To demonstrate how to use some of the features of CGS Civil 3D Tools, we will use an example project that consists of a road alignment with profiles and cross sections. You can download the example project file from this link[^5^].
  
### Create Alignment with Stick Method
  
One of the features of CGS Civil 3D Tools is the ability to create an alignment with the stick method. This method allows you to draw an alignment by clicking on points along the desired path. The alignment will automatically follow the curvature of the points and adjust its tangents and curves accordingly. This is useful when you want to create an alignment based on existing features or sketches.
  
To create an alignment with the stick method using CGS Civil 3D Tools:

1. Open the example project file in AutoCAD Civil 3D.
2. Select "Create Alignment with Stick Method" from the "Alignment & Profiles" panel on the " 0f148eb4a0
