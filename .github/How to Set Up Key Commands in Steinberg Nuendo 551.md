In this article, we will show you how to set up key commands in Steinberg Nuendo 551, using the following steps:
 
1. Accessing the Key Commands dialog
2. Searching for functions and assigning keys
3. Saving and loading key command presets
4. Restoring default key commands

## Accessing the Key Commands dialog
 
The Key Commands dialog is where you can view, modify and create key commands for Nuendo 551. To open it, you can either select **File > Key Commands** from the menu bar, or press **Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + K** on your keyboard[^1^].
 
The Key Commands dialog has three main sections: **Category**, **Command** and **Type in Key**. The Category section lists all the available categories of functions, such as *Edit*, *Transport*, *Mixer*, etc. The Command section lists all the functions within the selected category, such as *Cut*, *Paste*, *Mute*, etc. The Type in Key section shows the current key command for the selected function, and allows you to enter a new one.
 
## Searching for functions and assigning keys
 
If you want to find a specific function or tool and assign a key command to it, you can use the search field at the top of the Key Commands dialog. Simply type in a keyword or part of a function name, and Nuendo 551 will display all the matching results in the Command section. For example, if you type in "fade", you will see all the functions related to fade editing.
 
To assign a key command to a function, select it from the Command section and click on the Type in Key field. Then press the key or combination of keys that you want to use for that function. For example, if you want to assign **F5** to open the MediaBay window, select *MediaBay > Open MediaBay Window* from the Command section and press **F5** on your keyboard. You will see **F5** appear in the Type in Key field.
 
If the key or combination of keys that you entered is already assigned to another function, Nuendo 551 will warn you with a message below the Type in Key field. You can either choose a different key command for your function, or overwrite the existing one by clicking on **Assign Anyway**. You can also delete a key command by selecting it from the Type in Key field and pressing **Delete**.
 
## Saving and loading key command presets
 
If you want to save your custom key commands as a preset file, you can click on the **Store Preset...** button at the bottom of the Key Commands dialog. This will open a file browser where you can name and save your preset file as an XML document. You can store multiple presets for different purposes or projects.
 
To load a preset file, click on the **Preset...** button at the bottom of the Key Commands dialog. This will open a drop-down menu where you can select one of your saved presets or one of the default presets that come with Nuendo 551. For example, if you want to use the Cubase preset that mimics the key commands of Cubase, select *C*
