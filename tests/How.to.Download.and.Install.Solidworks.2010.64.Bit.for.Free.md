## Step 1: Download the torrent file
 
The first step is to download the torrent file that contains the Solidworks 2010 64 bit installation files and the crack files. A torrent file is a small file that contains information about the files and folders that are shared by peers using a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. You can use a torrent client such as uTorrent or BitTorrent to download the torrent file and the actual files from other users who have them.
 
One possible source of the torrent file is [^1^], where you can find a link to download it from FileFactory. The torrent file is named SW\_2k10.rar and has a size of 10.15 GB. Alternatively, you can also find another source of the torrent file at [^2^], where you can download it from Strikingly. The torrent file is named solidworks-2010-64-bit-serial-torrent.rar and has a size of 9.92 GB.
 
## Step 2: Extract the installation files and the crack files
 
After downloading the torrent file, you need to extract the installation files and the crack files from the compressed archive. You can use a software such as WinRAR or 7-Zip to do this. The installation files are in ISO format, which means they are disk images that can be mounted or burned to a DVD. The crack files are patched DLL files that can be used to bypass the activation process of Solidworks 2010 64 bit.
 
If you downloaded the torrent file from [^1^], you will need a password to extract the files. The password is "www.softarchive.net". If you downloaded the torrent file from [^2^], you will not need a password to extract the files.
 
## Step 3: Install Solidworks 2010 64 bit
 
The next step is to install Solidworks 2010 64 bit on your computer.
